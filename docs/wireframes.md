- Touch-friendly buttons

### Mobile (320px - 767px)
- Bottom navigation
- Single column layouts
- Card-based design
- Swipe gestures
- Larger touch targets (44px minimum)

## 13. Accessibility Considerations

### Navigation

- Skeleton screens for loading states
- Progressive image loading
- Lazy loading for below-fold content
- Optimized asset delivery

### Data Management
- Pagination for large lists
- Infinite scroll with virtual scrolling
- Client-side caching
- Offline functionality for key features

### Mobile Performance

## Implementation Notes

### Design System
- Use consistent spacing (8px grid system)
- Typography scale (16px base, 1.25 ratio)
- Color palette with semantic meanings
- Icon library (Lucide React)

### Component Library
- Reusable card components
- Form input components
- Button variants and states
- Modal/dialog components
- Navigation components

### State Management
- User authentication state
- Resume upload/processing state
- Application tracking state
- UI state (loading, errors, success)

This wireframe documentation provides the complete structure for implementing the Resume Tailor application UI. Each section can be developed incrementally following the 30-day roadmap timeline.
